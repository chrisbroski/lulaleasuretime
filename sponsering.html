<h1>LuLaRoe Fashion Consultant Business Overview</h1>

<p>The business opportunity for each LuLaRoe Fashion Consultant is quite simple; sell LuLaRoe clothing at Pop-Up Boutiques or Open Houses and make between 35-60% profit on every item you sell based on the suggested retail price. Additionally, if you  choose to build a team, you can earn additional income from your team’s sales.

<h2>How It Works</h2>

<p>LuLaRoe clothing is sold by Fashion Consultants, on the spot, at Pop-Up Boutiques and Open Houses. Think of them as mobile dress-up parties where your friends and neighbors can just come and shop. Based on the number of attendees at a Pop-Up Boutique we see an average sales volume of around 20 items, with an average profit of $15 per item. The more parties you have and the more products you sell, the more money you will earn. As a company, we recommend rewarding the hostess of a boutique with one free item for every 10 items that are sold. This is a guideline, and we encourage you to be generous in your hostess rewards as you seek to build your business through strong partnerships within your individual network. Wholesale prices range from $8.50 to $31 per item, and suggested retail prices range from $18 to $65. Because products come in a wide array of colors, patterns, prints and fabrics, you will receive an assortment of clothing in the sizes and body styles you choose. Adult sizes run from XXS to 3XL (0-26), and girls’ sizes run from 2-14. LuLaRoe pays for all costs to ship your product to you. All orders ship from the warehouse within 5 business days from the time that they receive your payment. Many Consultants choose to share the LuLaRoe opportunity. Helping others build their  own LuLaRoe businesses can increase your personal income. By building your team, you have opportunities to become a leader, earn extra income and to help others succeed.

<h2>What Comes in My Initial Order?</h2>

<p>Your ability to showcase and market the product depends in large part on the variety and size of inventory you carry at any given time. The more options your customers have to choose from, the more likely they are to make multiple purchases and to tell others about your products. To best establish an appropriate initial inventory, your initial order will include about 350 pieces.

<p>The initial package and the optional package add on! I will text you the latest on boarding kit! Please remember that because the Queue is a 8-10 week wait, this on boarding package can change several times before you on board.

<h2><a href="https://youtu.be/YLT3Ti_R2vA">The DeAnne Interview Video</a></h2>

<p>I have heard from everyone how amazing DeAnne is! She takes time to meet with each consultant and treats everyone as if they are family!  She truly wants everyone to be successful in this business! I met her at the Inspire Las Vegas this past June, during a leggings party. The next day  I started a crowd chant during the on boarding lottery and they decided to pick EVERYONE! LOL good times :)

    <li>Create a business email address. Please use LuLaRoe and your name. However, do not use your location, city or state. lularoe.stacyleasure@gmail.com for example. Its best to use gmail because you will need it for your goggle doc’s.

    <li>Register with state and federal entities. Check with your city to see if you need a business license. You do not have to collect sales tax! Audrey enables LuLaRoe to do it for us!
    <li>Set up 2 business bank accounts and 1 savings account. The first checking account will be your main account. You deposit your money from boutiques into this account and you will keep money in here to pay for orders and consignment. The second account is where you can deposit your profit. The savings account can be used to save @ 25% of the profit to use for income tax next April.
    <li>Set up an account with USPS.com  and Shipping Easy http://shippingeasy.com/easyreferral/?c=8EZ27D69
    <li>Begin the 72 Hour Game Plan. You can find a document about this in Audrey. Go to Tools/Assets. Then go to Documents. This is essential to a great start with your business. I did the 72 Hour Game plan and it works! This is the 72 Hour Game Plan!
        <ol>
            <li>Commit to “Building your Business” (you are doing this by completing this list)
            <li>Make a list of 50 names – people who love clothing.
            <li>Book your popups.
            <li>Promote your boutique though social media, phone calls, evites &amp; flyers.
            <li>REPEAT steps 1-4 yourself and with your group.
        </ol>
    <li>Schedule your Launch Party. Make it fun and exciting! Don’t feel like you need to have “it all together” to launch. Create urgency and excitement with your friends, neighbors, family, etc. Invite everyone! I had mine at my sister's house about 1000 miles away!<br><br>
    Promote it through social media &amp; create an invite that you can print at Costco or another photo center and distribute. There are great templates made by our in house graphic artist in Audrey! You can find these on your Audrey Dashboard. Go to Tools/Assets. Then go to Photo Gallery.

<p>If you have questions or concerns – PLEASE ASK!

<h3>Please contact your sponsor (Me!) first with any questions.</h3>

<p>Feel free to reach out to our Facebook Teams for training advice, etc. but please know that positive interactions are expected. If you need to vent, that is what I am here for!

<p>Please contact the home office with questions as a last resort. LuLaRoe is growing like CRAZY, so the phones stay so busy. If I can help you with a question, we can save them some time!

<p>Spend time getting to know Audrey while you await your BOXES! There are video galore on YouTube that you can watch while you are waiting to onboard!

<p>At your first few Pop Ups, I suggest you encourage shoppers to purchase with cash or check so that you have “quick cash” to turn around, reinvest and grow your inventory. Once you have paid yourself back and have had time to grow a large enough inventory, this becomes less of an issue!

<p>Be on the look out for the Inspire training tour in your area! And Convention 2017 Ontario, CA! I highly suggest you trying to attend as these are very beneficial to your business!

<p>Attached is the application, LLR policy &amp; procedures! If at any time you have any questions please don't hesitate to reach out to me!
